## About The Project 

A facility location problem is solved by finding the optimum placement of a facility in a given data set. A simple facility location problem is on general graphs is NP-hard to solve optimally, by reduction from the set cover problem The problem can be divided into 2 types of problems: Capacitated and Uncapacitated.

UFLS is a tool for solving uncapacitated facility location problems. 3 different approaches are available to solve the facility location problem:

1. Clustering Approach
2. Set Covering Approach
3. Iterative Approach
